# Style Guides

This repository contains style guides for all languages used on OpenTrons projects.

## Why?

Code is read far more often than it is written.  When all developers adhere to a common coding style, new developers can pick up more easily where old developers left off.

## But...

If you have any comments or questions about the style guides or want to recommend a change, bring that up to the team and we'll all discuss it.
